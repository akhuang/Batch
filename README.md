Batch
=====

<a href="http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch" target="_blank">Batch</a> is a lovingly designed and crafted suite of 300 icons for web and user interface design. Each icon is a single Photoshop shape layer meaning they can be scaled up – and down – without loss of quality. Adding layer styles and blend modes is also a breeze
